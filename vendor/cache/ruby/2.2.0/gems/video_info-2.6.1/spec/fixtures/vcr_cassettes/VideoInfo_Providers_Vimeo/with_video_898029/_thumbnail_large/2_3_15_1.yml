        video taken live from Deafheaven live in Jakarta on May 8th 2014 at The Basement
        Cafe, Kemang Raya, Jakarta.\n\nDeafheaven is an American post-black metal
        band that formed in 2010 in San Francisco, California, United States. The
        group began as a two-piece with George Clarke and Kerry McCoy who recorded
        and self-released a demo album together. After a warm reception, Deafheaven
        recruited three new members and began to tour. Before the close of 2010, the
        band signed to Deathwish Inc. and later released their debut album Roads to
        Judah in April 2011. The follow-up album, Sunbather, was released on June
        11, 2013. After another lineup change, the band toured for the album extensively
        and are still on a massive international tour.\n\nDeafheaven formed in February
        2010 in San Francisco with vocalist George Clarke and guitarist Kerry McCoy,
        who previously performed in a grindcore band together. Clarke isn''t sure
        how he arrived on the name Deafheaven, though he is aware of its appearance
        in William Shakespeare''s Sonnet 29. The two words ''deaf'' and ''heaven''
        were combined as an homage to Slowdive.\n\nClarke and McCoy recorded the Demo
        album in April 2010 at Atomic Garden Studios, which was released both on cassette
        tape in limited quantities and digitally. The untitled demo featured four
        songs that combined traditional screamo with black metal and post-rock. Originally,
        Deafheaven didn''t intend to release the material, but they later sent it
        out to a few of their favorite blogs.\n\nAfter the demo had been positively
        received, Clarke and McCoy recruited three additional musicians - bassist
        Derek Prine, guitarist Nick Bassett of the shoegaze bands Whirr (formerly
        Whirl) and Nothing, and drummer Trevor Deschryver, who responded to an ad
        on Craigslist - to form a five-piece group, and started playing their first
        shows in July 2010.\n\nFilmed by megalauman\nsound recorded by Zoom H4n\nEdited
